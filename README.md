# Key Changes and Features of Named Routes Implementation:
## Centralized Route Management:

A route.dart file has been added to define all named routes in one place. This centralizes route management and simplifies the addition or modification of navigation paths.<br>
**Named Routes:**

Screens are now accessed using named identifiers instead of manual navigation calls.<br>
For example, instead of directly using Navigator.push, you can now navigate with Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/about').<br><br>
**Ease of Navigation:**

Named routes provide a more readable and intuitive way to navigate between screens, especially in apps with multiple pages.<br><br>
**Consistency:**

All navigation logic is standardized, ensuring consistency throughout the app.<br><br>
**Improved Maintainability:**

If a route name or path needs to be updated, changes are made in a single location (route.dart), reducing the chances of errors and improving maintainability.<br><br>
**Support for Dynamic Routing:**

Named routes also support passing arguments to screens, making the navigation system more powerful and flexible.
